# Quest Sideloader 

### License: MIT

### Requires: .NET Framework 4.6.1

This is a simple, open source application to easily automate the Oculus Quest and Go sideloading process for end users.

It automatically downloads a light version of ADB from Google, and provides straightforward instructions to direct the user towards enabling ADB access to their device.

If it is bundled with a file called autoinstall.apk, upon launch and device detection it will prompt the user if they wish to install the auto-apk. If not, the user may drag and drop an APK file onto the window to install it.

Obviously, like most tools this can be used for good or by malicious actors. 

## NEVER INSTALL APKs FROM SOURCES YOU DO NOT TRUST!
